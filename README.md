# mabbit_bmi_calc

My attempt at creating a more fully-featured BMI app, based on the exercise in the AppBrewery Flutter course.

## Goals

- Enable calculation based on gender and age, not just weight.
- Add support for interchanging between imperial and metric units.
- Add a settings page for units of measure, light/dark mode, etc.
- Centralize the UI theme using ThemeData.
